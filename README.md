# React Hangman

To sharpen the edge of my React blade, I built a game of hangman.

### Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```

### To-Dos
- Sort out CSS (sizing and position of Hanged man)
- Make mobile friendly
- Link to live example
- Improve win screen
- Add more words and clues (& move data to separate file)
- Easy / medium / hard game mode?
-
